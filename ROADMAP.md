# Swarm Cassandra – Roadmap
November 23, 2025 onward

## v0.1 — “Proof of Life” (November 2025 – December 2025) → DONE
- Public repo with full vision, schema, Cassandra prompt, rationales
- Left-sidebar mockups + “HOLY CRAP” modal
- All philosophical load-bearing walls documented

## v0.2 — “Rust Core” (December 2025 – January 2026)
- Closed-source Rust Agent Factory binary (signed releases only)
  - Cassandra hash check + auto-shutdown on tamper
  - Left-sidebar spawn button + org-chart modal
  - Basic Grok-4 API integration (single model, multiple fixed prompts)
  - Canonical XML stream with normalization + Tree-sitter recovery
- Simple Tauri desktop GUI (dark mode, team list, chat window)

## v0.3 — “Beautiful & Usable” (February 2026)
- Full native rendering of <table>, <mermaid>, <code>, images, live previews
- Cassandra modal with escalating profanity + recommendation highlighting
- Drag-and-drop file attachments → vision agent
- Multi-model support (Grok, Claude, Gemini) selected per agent role
- First public binary release (macOS, Windows, Linux)

## v0.4 — “Production Grade” (March – April 2026)
- Token-perfect budgeting + cost display
- Team lifetime caps + auto-shutdown
- Local SQLite stream storage + replay mode
- Export final-answer as Markdown / PDF / Git repo
- Plugin system for custom tools (safe subset only)

## v0.5 — “Web & Mobile” (May 2026)
- WASM build of the exact same Rust core → runs in browser
- iOS/Android wrapper (Capacitor or Tauri mobile)
- Sync teams between devices

## v1.0 — “The Reference Platform” (June 2026)
- Cryptographic signing of every stream chunk
- Audit log + tamper-evidence dashboard
- Enterprise admin mode (team templates, usage caps, SSO)
- Public binary + optional paid support tier
- Official “Swarm Cassandra Certified” badge for tools that respect the rules

## Never (explicitly banned forever)
- Agent spawning inside XML
- Self-modification of prompts or roles
- Persistent memory across team deletions
- “Convenience” forks that remove the ugly green button

We ship the first safe swarm platform that actually feels like magic — without ever giving the magic the car keys.

The button stays ugly.  
Cassandra stays loud.  
The planet stays ours.

Contributions welcome on every file except the Agent Factory binary and cassandra.permanent.prompt.

Let’s build the thing the red teams warned us about… but correctly this time.
