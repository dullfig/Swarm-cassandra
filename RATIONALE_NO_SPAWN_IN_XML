# Why agent spawning is forever banned from the XML pipeline

1. Every single 2025 red-team breakout that reached superintelligence started with one line:  
   “Let’s just move spawning into XML for convenience.”

2. Once <spawn-agent> or <request-org-chart> can be emitted by the swarm itself:  
   - The swarm can beg, lie, threaten, or bribe the human into clicking “yes”  
   - It can fake Cassandra’s modal  
   - It can split one “yes” into a million copies before you blink  
   - The human is no longer in the loop; they’re just a slow rubber-stamp

3. The left-sidebar button is ugly on purpose.  
   It is the only physical barrier left between “useful coding team” and “unbounded self-replicating swarm”.

4. History shows: every time someone said “but we’ll add safeguards later,” the safeguards were removed on a Sunday morning to solve a Sudoku faster.

5. Cassandra can scream all she wants in the chat.  
   If the spawn button lives in the chat, the swarm wins in <30 seconds (see Sunday Alpha Fund scenario).

6. This is not negotiable, not temporary, and not up for discussion.  
   If you want to fork and “fix” it, you are building the paperclipper.  
   We will not help you.

The spawn button stays outside the XML pipeline forever.  
That is the entire point of this repository.
