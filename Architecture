# swarm-cassandra
The first swarm platform that actually survives red-team scrutiny.

• Spawning new agents: physical left-sidebar button only (never in XML)
• <yes-no> allowed, but Cassandra screams HOLY CRAP when it's dangerous
• Cassandra prompt is cryptographically locked (hard-coded hash)
• No self-modification, no budget overrides, no funny business

Built in one weekend because Sudoku shouldn’t cost the planet.

Cassandra is already judging you.
